  "readme": "# livedb-mongo\r\n\r\nMongoDB database adapter for [livedb](https://github.com/share/livedb). This driver can be used both as a snapshot\r\nstore and oplog.\r\n\r\nSnapshots are stored where you'd expect (the named collection with\r\n\\_id=docName). Operations are stored in `COLLECTION_ops`. If you have a\r\nusers collection, the operations are stored in `users_ops`. If you have a\r\ndocument called `fred`, operations will be stored in documents called `fred\r\nv0`, `fred v1`, `fred v2` and so on.\r\n\r\nJSON document snapshots in livedb-mongo are unwrapped so you can use mongo\r\nqueries directly against JSON documents. (They just have some extra fields in\r\n    the form of `_v` and `_type`). You should always use livedb to edit\r\ndocuments - don't just edit them directly in mongo. You'll get weird behaviour\r\nif you do.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nLiveDB-mongo wraps [mongoskin](https://github.com/kissjs/node-mongoskin). It\r\npasses all the arguments straight to mongoskin's constructor. `npm install\r\nlivedb-mongo` then create your database wrapper using the same arguments you\r\nwould pass to mongoskin:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar livedbmongo = require('livedb-mongo');\r\nvar mongo = livedbmongo('localhost:27017/test?auto_reconnect', {safe:true});\r\n\r\nvar livedb = require('livedb').client(mongo); // Or whatever. See livedb's docs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer, you can instead create a mongoskin instance yourself and pass it to livedb-mongo:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar mongoskin = require('mongoskin');\r\nvar skin = mongoskin('localhost:27017/test?auto_reconnect', {safe:true});\r\n\r\nvar livedbmongo = require('livedb-mongo');\r\nvar mongo = livedbmongo(skin);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 by Joseph Gentle and Nate Smith\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
